            <h2>
                Death rate from outdoor pollution vs GDP per capita
            </h2> 
    
            <p>
                When comparing the death rate from outdoor pollution to gdp per capita, we observe that countries with a lower gdp per capita have a higher death rate from outdoor air pollution. This correlation may be due to lower income countries having to rely on cheap and fast energy compare to richer countries who can afford renewable energy sources. A great example of this would be Iraq, with it’s incredibly large use of fossil fuels from oil and natural gases. It is heavily reliant on these natural resources in order to support their exports and also their own energy needs. A key reason is due to the low income of people and 30% of the population being in poverty. With such low financial resources, people use local diesel generators as a cheap source of energy. Consequently, the local diesel generators lead to a lot of air pollution being produced in the local areas and thus result in many people to suffer from poor health.

                Outdoor air pollution death rate
            </h2> 
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> 
                The heat map illustrates a high mortality rate in the sub-saharan regions of Africa, South Asia and parts Southeast Asia. With many countries such as Chad, India, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea showing the highest amounts, indicating poor air quality. In contrast, most of Europe, North America and Australia show significantly lower rates. This may be due to stricter environmental regulations and cleaner energy sources. For example, industrial processes, pollution from vehicles, biomass burning and a lower reliance on fossil fuels for energy needs compared to developing nations. Additionally, due to the fact that developing nations usually need more cheap resources in order to grow, urbanisation and deforestation usually lower air quality leading to high-risk areas. This clearly highlights how more awareness and action should be brought towards air pollution and the overarching problem, helping lower income countries to prevent the use of cheap resources leading to more potential deaths.

                Exposure to particulate matter air pollution
            </h2> 
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                The heatmaps between death rate to outdoor air pollution and exposure to particulate matter (PM 2.5) demonstrates a high correlation. The highest exposure of particulate air matter in 2019 were found to be in the regions such as South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), parts of the Middle East, and Central and East Africa. These areas also exhibit the highest death counts to air pollution in 2021 which suggests how particulate matter can be a severe harm to the population when in prolonged exposure. However, there are some Sub-Saharan African regions experiencing high death rates from air pollution despite moderate particulate matter levels; implying other factors are contributing such as indoor biomass burning and poor medical infrastructure. 

Conversely, regions with lower particulate matter such as North America and much of Europe show significantly lower death rates which reinforces how particulate air is linked to human health. Overall, the data suggests that there’s a strong relationship between death rates to air pollution and particulate air matter with regional variations influenced by socio-economic factors.

            <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem;">
                The outdoor air pollution deathrate also shows a strong correlation to age. This suggests how the weaker bodies of older people are much more prone to air pollution than younger generations.

                Deaths from air pollution
            </h2> 
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> 
                The most notable decrease is seen in deaths from indoor air pollution which has dropped sharply. This is most likely due to improvements in household energy sources and more regulations on indoor appliances. However, it is clear that outdoor particulate matter still remains a problem as it has not decreased over the year since 1990. This suggests that although indoor areas such as buildings and homes may have seen improvements in cleaner air, outdoor air pollution has not and may be due to the largely unsustainable energy sources and industrial emissions.
