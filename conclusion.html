                Overall, it can be concluded that outdoor air pollution is still a major threat to human health with many countries with lower gdp per capita and income having higher death rates. This may be highly likely due to the fact that lower income countries and developing nations require cheap resources such as coal and natural gases to power their energy leading to high particulate matter levels. Consequently, because of such reliances, it also leads to everyday life being heavily polluted and with long exposure, the data demonstrates that it can heavily affect human health. In contrast, countries with higher GDP per capita such as the US and other European countries are able to reduce their emissions through employing more sustainable infrastructure such as solar panels and wind turbines. This is because although such infrastructure costs more to obtain and maintain, their higher income makes up for the losses. Thus, with ever increasing needs for more resources, it is important that more awareness is brought to this global issue and that more support is provided for better infrastructure to improve air quality.
