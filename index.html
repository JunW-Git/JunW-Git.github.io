                As of the present day, rises in fossil fuel use and hydrocarbons has led to more air pollution than ever. The poor quality of air in many areas of the world has led to potential risks and harm to both the environment and humans. In this report, we investigate the health threats that may come from outdoor air pollution and particulate air matter.

                With no trend to discontinue the use of non-renewable energy sources and unsustainable industrial practices, it is clear that an investigation into how this is affecting the human population. Not only is it currently affecting the health of and quality of life of many people, it is also causing millions of deaths per year. This is a major issue that needs to be addressed and we hope to increase awareness to the public in order to prevent this global problem.
